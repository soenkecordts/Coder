# {Coder for C#}
**Welcome!** 

{Coder for C#} is a simple development environment for people, who want to learn programming. It includes a library of graphical functions and classes to make it easy and fun. The concept comes from Processing.org, a great development environment for programming visual elements and learning programming. 

{Coder for C#} is free and open source. It draws inspiration and guidance from its precursor Processing and P5.JS. However, it is a new interpretation, not a port. It should not match Processing's set of functionality exactly. Instead it should be a software for learning programming with fun. The [{Coder for C#} website](https://www2.wi.hs-flensburg.de/media/pb/coder/) contains an  overview of the project, a documentation yet to be written :wink:, tutorials and examples.

{Coder for C#} uses the programming language C# (pronounced CSharp), which is easy to learn and is used for simple as well as complex programs.
